# HR Analytics Dashboard: Data Analysis Project

![](https://github.com/harshbakshi/HR_Analytics_Dashboard/blob/main/HR%20Dashboard.pdf)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end HR Analytics solution designed to investigate employee turnover trends for a multinational corporation. Acting as a Data Detective, I analyzed a comprehensive HR dataset to uncover hidden factors causing valuable employees to leave, providing actionable insights for the management team.

The project bridges the gap between raw data and business intelligence by utilizing SQL for heavy-duty data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for interactive storytelling through visualization.

## 🚀 Key Objectives & Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Pre-processing (SQL)
Before analysis, the raw dataset required significant cleaning to ensure accuracy:

- Standardization: Fixed inconsistent date formats for birth_date and hire_date.

- Data Transformation: Renamed columns for clarity and updated data types (e.g., converting strings to dates).

- Feature Engineering: Created a new age column using SQL functions to calculate employee age from birth dates.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I wrote complex SQL queries to solve specific business challenges, including:

- Demographics: Analyzing the gender and race breakdown of the current workforce.

- Age Distribution: Grouping employees into age brackets to see which generations dominate the company.

- Work Environment: Comparing the count of employees working at Headquarters versus those working remotely.

- Employee Tenure: Calculating the average length of employment for staff who have been terminated.

- Attrition Analysis: Identifying which departments suffer from the highest termination rates.

### 3. Interactive Dashboarding (Power BI)
- The insights extracted from SQL were imported into Power BI to create a dynamic dashboard.

- Visualizations: Used bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to display demographic trends.

- Interactivity: Implemented filters for departments, job titles, and locations to allow stakeholders to drill down into specific data points.
